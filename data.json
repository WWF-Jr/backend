        "This rare species can only be found in Southeast Asia, mainly in Borneo",
        "The Javan Rhinos are the most threatened of the five rhino species",
        "Also known as\"Baiji\" or \"Goddess of the Yangtze\", the Yangtze River Dolphin is a critically endangered species and according to scientists, the species may already be extinct.",
        "Unlike Giant Pandas, the Red Pandas are much smaller and have a red, bear-like body which is larger than a domestic cat, and thick russet fur",
        "Unlike Giant Pandas, the Red Pandas are much smaller and have a red, bear-like body which is larger than a domestic cat, and thick russet fur",
        "What's amazing about the Saiga Antelope is the animal's amazing migrations, and apart from moving around in groups (which is totally normal), the species has other reasons to increase their momentum: loss of habitat and illegal hunting",
        "Oh my, that looks like an elf! It’s actually a Langur Chato, a primate found in Asia, that lives up to 13,000 feet above ground",
        "It's funny that the Indonesians gave the Proboscis Monkey the nickname 'Dutch Monkey'",
	"The pangolin is the world’s only scaled mammal. Imagine a cross between an armadillo, an anteater and a viper – that’s the pangolin",
	"Unlike the pangolin, African elephants have incredibly strong family relationships. They’re astonishingly intelligent and compassionate, and poaching creates innumerable elephant orphans",
	"The lion’s kingdom shrinks every year. Habitat loss is its greatest threat; as human populations increase, lions are forced into smaller territories that cannot sustain their numbers",
	"The world’s fastest mammal is also one of nature’s toughest independent mothers. Female cheetahs live in solitude, raising their young, hiding them from predators and hunting for them alone",
	"The world’s most effective predator is one of the most rarely seen safari animals. Their packs require lots of protected space because they can range over 25 miles regularly",
	"The lion, leopard, African buffalo, endangered black rhino, and elephant make up the legendary Big Five. Tanzania is one of the last places on earth you can spot them all in one day",
	"Seeing wild mountain gorillas is one of the greatest treasures in the world of wildlife viewing. Like elephants, gorillas have extremely strong family connections. Some rangers have devoted their lives to raising juvenile gorillas orphaned by poaching",
	"A white-furred, desert-loving antelope, the addax is nearly extinct in the Saharan deserts. Their numbers continue to dwindle due to poaching and the ecological disturbance caused by oil exploration"

	"asia": "Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres (17,212,000 sq mi), about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Its 4.5 billion people (as of June 2019) constitute roughly 60% of the world's population.",
        "africa": "Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent, after Asia in both cases. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20% of its land area. With 1.3 billion people as of 2018, it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population. Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents; the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4. Despite a wide range of natural resources, Africa is the least wealthy continent per capita, in part due to geographic impediments, legacies of European colonization in Africa and the Cold War, predatory/neo-colonialistic activities by Western nations and China, and undemocratic rule and deleterious policies. Despite this low concentration of wealth, recent economic expansion and the large and young population make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context.",
        "south-america": "South America is a continent entirely in the Western Hemisphere and mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be described as the southern subcontinent of the Americas. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in recent decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).",
        "north-america": "North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be described as the northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea, and to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean. Because it is on the North American Tectonic Plate, Greenland is included as part of North America geographically.",
        "europe": "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost peninsulas of the continental landmass of Eurasia, and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Although much of this border is over land, Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of its history and traditions.",
        "australia": "Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. It is the largest country in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest country. Australia's population of nearly 26 million, in an area of 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300 sq mi), highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard. Canberra is the nation's capital, while the largest city is Sydney, and other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide.",
        "antartica": "Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At 14,200,000 square kilometres (5,500,000 square miles), it is the fifth-largest continent and nearly twice the size of Australia. It is by far the least populated continent, with around 5,000 people in the summer and around 1,000 in the winter. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 km (1.2 mi; 6,200 ft) in thickness, which extends to all but the McMurdo Dry Valleys and the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula."
